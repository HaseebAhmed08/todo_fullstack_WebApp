# Todo Full-Stack Web Application - Agent Creation Tasks

## Feature: Create 6 specialized agents as .md files

This feature creates 6 specialized agent files to support the Spec-Kit Plus driven development workflow for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application.

## Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create directory structure for agent files at claude/agents/

## Phase 2: Agent Creation
- [ ] T002 [P] [US1] Create Spec Writer Agent file at claude/agents/spec_writer_agent.md
- [ ] T003 [P] [US1] Create Architecture Planner Agent file at claude/agents/architecture_planner_agent.md
- [ ] T004 [P] [US1] Create Database Engineer Agent file at claude/agents/database_engineer_agent.md
- [ ] T005 [P] [US1] Create Backend Engineer Agent file at claude/agents/backend_engineer_agent.md
- [ ] T006 [P] [US1] Create Frontend Engineer Agent file at claude/agents/frontend_engineer_agent.md
- [ ] T007 [P] [US1] Create Integration Tester Agent file at claude/agents/integration_tester_agent.md

## Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] T008 Verify all 6 agent files have been created successfully
- [ ] T009 Confirm each agent file contains appropriate role-specific instructions

## Dependencies
- None - this is foundational work for the project

## Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Tasks T002-T007 can all be executed in parallel as they create separate files

## Implementation Strategy
- Create each agent file with role-specific responsibilities and constraints
- Ensure each agent follows the Spec-Kit Plus methodology
- Focus on separation of concerns between different aspects of the application
